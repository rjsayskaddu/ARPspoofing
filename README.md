# ARPspoofing
Project made for my subject Network Information and Security where I performed M-I-T-M attack (Man-in-the-middle attack).
It contains 3 python files. One sends packets to the target, one keep tracks of the activities of the target and provide us back with information and the last one tells the target whether it is under attack or not and sends email with the timestamp and MAC address of the attacker to the given email-id.
